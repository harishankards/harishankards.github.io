## Hobbies

### Cooking
I love cooking. I taught myself cooking through online and WOM by trying
to reproduce spicy dishes I like. I learnt to cook many South Indian, North Indian, Chinese, Arabian dishes. Recently I have been learning Thai dishes. I am always up to learn how to to cook a exotic new dish.

### Hiking
I love traveling a lot. That's what brought me into this. At least two sundays in a month I do hiking. Taking bus to some unknown village nearby, wandering around there, chatting with people out there is one thing I like most.

### Parkour
I was introduced into this during my NCC as a part of military obstacle course training. Then I got more enthu on it. Whenever I get perfect time and company, parkour will be my ultimate sophistication.

### A good chat
There's nothing like an interesting chat over a barbeque (maybe a couple), talking shop, programming, business, travel, cats, anything really. If you're in town and want to meet up, be sure to holler! Surely a social butterfly, but I will lose my wings when it comes to texting or talking on phone. Meet me and Iâ€™ll entertain you.

### Travel
I was lucky enough when I was a kid to live in a lot of different places. I kind of got the taste for travel afterwards, and I love visiting new places and meeting the people there.

### Photography
This one never bores me of. Interested in shooting Nature and Architectures than people.

### Interior design
Not only web and graphic design, I also love interior design. My right brain always wins my left and ends up giving better results in designing things than any other. Does free interior designing at home, office, neighborhood and wherever I can influence.  

### Past Hobbies
I previously enjoyed boating, horseback riding and playing computer games. However, I have not had time to do
any of these things recently.
