<img src="/images/hs3.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">

Hi! I'm Harishankar Ayandev. A student at College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University. Parkouring in real life with a passion for tech, design and entrepreneurship. 

I create software. Enjoy writing about what I learnt along the way. Also I'm involved in evangelizing the tools, frameworks, languages that I use.

Writing better software that people will love is my motto, and I'm always seeking new talents. Currently focused in web technologies and my main programming language is Ruby.


Some things I look for in the things I work on:

* make a difference in people's lives
* use the latest technologies
* have great design and experience
* leverage data in innovative ways
