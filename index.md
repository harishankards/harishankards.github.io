## About Me

<img src="/images/hs3.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">

Hey there! I'm Harishankar Ayandev. I'm kind of that guy who wants to make things more cooler.  Parkouring in real life with a great passion for tech, design and entrepreneurship.

I create software. Enjoy writing about what I learnt along the way, sometimes maybe. Also I'm involved in evangelizing the tools, frameworks, languages that I use.

Writing better software that people will love is my motto, and I'm always seeking new talents. Currently focused in web technologies and my main programming language is Javascript.


Some things I look for in the things I work on:

* make a difference in people's lives
* use the latest technologies
* have great design and experience
* leverage data in innovative ways
